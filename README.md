# 3D_Graphics-Animation_Project

Project is about a dystopian post-apocalyptic world where there is an abandoned home that has been surrounded and been destroyed by a sand storm with sand dunes and with weathered and degraded buildings. An automated ship scans for life or food or supplies in the area and buildings. The idea was inspired by Dune and Star Wars(Tatooine) to help create this scene.
