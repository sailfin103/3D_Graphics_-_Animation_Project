The Project i have made in Blender is of a Post-Apocalyptic Dystopian environment, in which a sandstorm has destroyed a city and now it is covered in sand with buildings in the sand all weathered and damaged. A small unmanned ship goes around the area to find if there are any survivours or any supplies to take.

Modelling Process: 
For the overall scene and environment, the idea was inspired by the movies Dune and Star Wars, mainly the scene in tatooine. I Set up the scene to look as chaotic and as random as possible with Streetlights half covered in sand, and electricity poles and buildings covered in sand. I chose a sunset scene to help emphasise the shadows casted by the buildings onto the sand to display how apocalyptic the scene is seen, with dim streetlights reflecting on the weathered steel. For the buildings, it was done by subdividing a cube and manipulating it so that parts of its face/vertices were missing to highlight the damage done to the building over time as well as creating a weathered metal texture through the use of nodes, to again show the damage done to the buildings.

The Sand dunes were done by adding modifiers to the plane such as the displace and subdivision surface as well as applying a texture made using nodes, such as noise texture and voronoi to help create the sand dune effect of the plane.

Materials:
The materials used were a mix of simple and more detailed, for the buildings i used a weathered metal texture i created with the help of online resources as well as the sand dune texture in the scene. For the house, and windmill, a wood texture also created by myself through online resources and nodes, was used to add more detail to the abandoned house. The house's windows were also created by adding transparency node onto the material to help create a window material.

Render Output:
I used cycles to render my scene with 4096 samples to ensure that all the small details are retained. I also used a sky texture for the background, the nishita sky texture to get the effect of a sunset casting rays onto the sand to help it look more realistic, as well as the shadows.
